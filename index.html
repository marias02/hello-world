      <p>Unlike other people, I was not born with my career path in mind. As a 
        matter of fact, it took me several years to find my passion. I went from
        possible barista to potential make up artist. Until one day, I tried a
        coding course, just to give it a chance. It was then, that 
        I realized that I had just found my passion.

        You see, there is something beautiful about coding. Maybe is because the
        possibilities are endless, or the idea that you can contribute to wonderful
        things around the world. I am not entirely sure. But what I do know is,
        that I want to change the world. 
        One line of code at a time!
