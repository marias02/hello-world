        <p>
            I fell in love with Software Engineering once I found out that it had no limits.
            I could build anything I would want with it, and the list would go on and on.
            Coding makes me feel like there is nothing that I cannot do. 
            I am excited to see where this journey takes me, and all the amazing things that 
            I can build with it.
